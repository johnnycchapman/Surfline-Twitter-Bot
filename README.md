# Wrightsville Beach, NC Surfline Twitter Bot ðŸŒŠ

This bot fetches the daily surf forecast from Surfline and automatically posts it to Twitter at 8 AM EST every day. The script is powered by GitHub Actions, which ensures the bot runs on schedule without manual intervention.

## How It Works
1. Fetches Surf Forecast: Uses the pysurfline API to retrieve wave conditions, sunrise, and sunset times for a specified surf spot.
2. Formats the Forecast: Extracts key details for 8 AM and 2 PM local time (EST) and converts them into a readable tweet.
3. Posts to Twitter: Uses tweepy to authenticate and post the forecast from a Twitter account.
4. Runs Daily at 8 AM EST: GitHub Actions schedules and executes the bot automatically.
